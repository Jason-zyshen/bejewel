# BeJewel.design

This is the test web app of my startup BeJewel. I'm going to build a eCommerce website from scratch. This will be a progressing process for sure. I will split the work into several stages.

## #1 DEFINE

At this first stage, my goal is to define the (very basic) system of this platform from a business perspective as well as a software architecture perspective.

### The Whole Picture

It requires a huge amount of work to develop all the systems I need to support this eCommerce platform business. To move this project move quickly, I will use as many third party services as possible so that I don't need to build everything in house. I will be very focus on the key features that differentiate us from other players in the market. But we still need to have a clear understanding of the systems/services we need for the business:

- Account/Login/Authentication
- Tax & Payment
- Marketing & Newsletter
- Inventory Management
- Order Management
- Transportation Management
- Product Management
- Legal Agreement

### Use Cases
